FreeNAS Configuration

SETTING UP PLEX
----------------


1. CREATE THE [VOLUME]:
    Storage > Volumes > ZFS Volume Manager
      Volume Name: [YOUR VOLUME NAME] (plex)

Plugins are built on light weight virtual machines - known as Jails - stored on system [VOLUMES].
We will create a dataset name MEDIA for our media.

2. CREATE DATASET:
    Storage > Volumes > [VOLUME NAME] > Create ZFS Dataset 
      Dataset Name: [DATASET NAME] (media)

3. CREATE A SIMPLE SHARE TO UPLOAD VIDEO:
    Sharing > Windows (CIFS) Shares > Add Windows (CIFS) Share
      Name: [SHARE NAME] (media)
      Path: [PATH TO DATASET] (/mnt/plex/media) [CREATED IN STEP 2 ABOVE]
      Allow Guest Access: [X]

4. CHANGE DATASET PERMISSIONS TO ALLOW GUESTS TO CONNECT:
    Storage > Volumes > [VOLUME NAME (Step 1)] > Change Permissions
      Mode: Write Other [X]
      Set permission recursively: [X]

5. UPLOAD VIDEO:
    Go to the IP address of the FreeNAS server to find the shared folder to upload video.
      \\FreeNAS\media

6. RESET PERMISSIONS:
    Any folders moved into the shared folder need their permissions set.
    Repeat step 4

7. INSTALL THE PLEX MEDIA SERVER PLUG
    Plugins > Name: Plex Media Server
    Install

8. LINK FILES IN [MEDIA] DATASET TO PLEX [MEDIA] IN JAIL
     Jails > plexs_1 > Storage > Add Storage
       Jail: plex_1
       Source: /mnt/plex/media (created in step 2)
       Destination: /media
